# FixBib
## Introduction

FixBib is a Greasemonkey script that can fix common errors when exporting
BibTeX format citation from Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM DL. It
analyses the BibTeX entry and presents the fixed ones on export pages. The
changes are highlighted for you to re-examine easily.

It is an attempt to automate the tedious manual fixing work. However, it almost
surely will not fix all problems. It might bring some errors too. Report issues
if you find them.

The latest stable release is available at [userscripts.org][us].
