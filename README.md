FixBib is a Greasemonky script that can fix common errors when exporting BibTeX format citation from Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM DL. It analyses the BibTeX entry and presents the fixed ones on export pages. The changes are highlighted for you to re-examine easily.

It is an attempt to automate the tedious manual fixing work. However, it almost surely will not fix all problems. It might bring some errors too. Report issues if you find them.

For an explanation of BibTeX errors, refer to <http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/biberrors.html>.
